# TaylorBall

## Senior Project – Baseball Analytics & Simulation

**TaylorBall** is a senior project developed as part of my undergraduate studies, combining baseball research, data analysis, and simulation modeling. The project explores how statistical modeling can be used to better understand player performance and team outcomes, with a focus on translating traditional and modern baseball data into actionable insights.

This repository represents the final form of the project as submitted for academic credit, along with supporting analysis and documentation.

## Project Overview

The goal of TaylorBall is to:

* Apply statistical and analytical techniques to baseball data
* Simulate aspects of baseball performance and outcomes
* Explore how data-driven methods can complement traditional baseball evaluation

The project draws inspiration from professional baseball analytics departments and public sabermetric research, with an emphasis on clear methodology and reproducible results.

## Academic Context

* **Project Type:** Final Project
* **Field of Study:** Baseball Analytics / Data Science / Sports Analytics
* **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks
* **Data Sources:** Publicly available baseball datasets (e.g., Lahman-style historical data)

This project was completed independently and reflects my ability to:

* Design and scope a long-term research project
* Work with real-world datasets
* Communicate results through code, visualizations, and written analysis

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

### Option 2: Using conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate taylorball
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Concepts Explored

* Baseball performance metrics
* Probabilistic and statistical modeling
* Simulation-based analysis
* Historical baseball data interpretation

---

## Results & Findings

The notebooks include:

* Exploratory data analysis of baseball datasets
* Custom metrics and modeling approaches
* Simulated scenarios to evaluate player or team performance

Interpretations and conclusions are discussed directly within the notebooks to mirror the structure of an academic research paper.

---

## Limitations & Future Work

As a senior project, TaylorBall prioritizes clarity and exploration over production-level optimization. Potential future improvements include:

* Refactoring reusable logic into standalone Python modules
* Adding automated tests
* Expanding simulations to additional seasons or datasets
* Improving documentation for external contributors
